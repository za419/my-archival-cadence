## About
Cadence is an online radio heavily inspired by 4chan/8ch's [R/a/dio](http://r-a-d.io/). The project is my first endeavour to practice a full-range of IT-skills. The code housed in this repository is primarily front end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

By default, the server plays all the genres of music I like, mostly classic rock, synthpop, and metal. But you'll also find anything from rap to orchestral to Jpop. I occasionally override the server and manually DJ.

Though the primary feature development of the radio has ended, I'm continually improving existing code as I learn. I intend to implement bigger features like a queryable database and a request bot once I've comfortably gained some new skills.
