# Cadence Radio [Listen Here](http://cadenceradio.com/)
## Background
Cadence is an online radio heavily inspired by 4chan/8ch's [R/a/dio](http://r-a-d.io/). The project is my first endeavour to practice a full-range of IT-skills. It currently utilizes technologies in front-end design with HTML and CSS, site scripting with JavaScript, and some networking and server management with both Windows Server 2016 and Debian. 

Currently, back-end work for a queryable music database, to handle music metadata, is now being built with PHP and SQL (MySQL). The database is populated using a [populator tool](https://github.com/kenellorando/cadence-database-populator) programmed in Python.

Once the database is completed, the final main feature will be a song request bot.
